# ðŸŽ‡Contributing Guidelines

This documentation contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process. 

I'm happy to welcome all the contributions from anyone willing to add new scripts to this repository. Thank you for helping out and remember,
**no contribution is too small.**


## ðŸ’»Before Contributing

Welcome to [sandeep-07/file-manager](https://github.com/sandeep-07/file-manager). Before sending your pull requests, make sure that you **read the whole
guidelines**. If you have any doubt on the contributing guide, please feel free to reach out.


## ðŸ™ŒContribution

    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/sandeep-07/file-manager.git
    ```
* Step 3: Keep your cloned repo upto date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)
    ```
    git pull upstream master https://github.com/sandeep-07/file-manager.git

    ```
* Step 5: Commit all the changes (Write commit message as "Small Message")
    ```
    git commit -m "Write a meaningfull but small commit message"
    ```
* Step 6: Push the changes for review
    ```
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
